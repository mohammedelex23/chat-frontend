# Chat Web App

A simple chat application built with **React + TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project is part of a full‑stack MERN application. The current focus is on the frontend, while the backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) will be developed later.

## ✨ Features
- Search and add friends
- Send and receive text messages
- Clean, responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **React (TypeScript)** — component‑based architecture with type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility‑first styling for rapid UI development
- **MERN stack** (planned) — backend with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

## 🚀 Status
Frontend in progress. Backend integration will follow in later stages.
